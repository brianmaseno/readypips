# 🔧 Pesapal Success Page Authentication Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **URL Parameters Not Recognized**
**Problem:** The success page was looking for `session_id` or `reference`, but Pesapal sends:
- `OrderTrackingId` - The tracking ID for the payment
- `OrderMerchantReference` - Your merchant reference

**Fix:** Updated the success page to recognize all payment provider parameters:
```typescript
const sessionId = searchParams.get("session_id"); // Stripe
const reference = searchParams.get("reference"); // Paystack
const orderTrackingId = searchParams.get("OrderTrackingId"); // Pesapal ✅
const merchantReference = searchParams.get("OrderMerchantReference"); // Pesapal ✅
```

### 2. **Provider Detection**
**Problem:** The code was only detecting Stripe (`cs_`) or defaulting to Paystack

**Fix:** Added proper Pesapal detection:
```typescript
let provider: string;
if (paymentId.startsWith("cs_")) {
  provider = "stripe";
} else if (orderTrackingId) {
  provider = "pesapal"; // ✅ Now properly detected
} else {
  provider = "paystack";
}
```

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
**Problem:** When verification failed, users had no options to retry

**Fix:** Added:
- ✅ Retry verification button
- ✅ Option to check dashboard directly
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Better user guidance

### 4. **Token Refresh Logic**
**Problem:** If the token was invalid, the page just failed

**Fix:** Added automatic token refresh and retry:
```typescript
if (response.status === 401) {
  console.log("⚠️ Token invalid, attempting to refresh auth...");
  await checkAuth();
  
  // Retry verification with refreshed token
  const newToken = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (newToken && newToken !== token) {
    return verifySubscription(paymentId); // ✅ Retry automatically
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### How Token is Maintained:

1. **Login:**
   - Token stored in `localStorage`
   - Auth context loads user data

2. **Subscription Payment:**
   - Token remains in `localStorage`
   - Used for creating payment session

3. **Pesapal Redirect:**
   - User redirected to Pesapal
   - Token still in `localStorage` (persisted)

4. **Return to Success Page:**
   - Token retrieved from `localStorage`
   - Used to verify payment
   - If token invalid, auto-refresh attempted

5. **Subscription Activation:**
   - User data updated in database
   - Auth context refreshed
   - Dashboard shows active subscription
