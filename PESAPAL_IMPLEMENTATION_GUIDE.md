   - Gets plan price in USD (e.g., $29)
   - Converts to KES at rate of 130 (e.g., KES 3,770)
   - Creates PesaPal order with correct amount
3. **User redirected to PesaPal** → Secure payment gateway
4. **Payment methods available:**
   - 📱 M-Pesa
   - 📱 Airtel Money
   - 💳 Visa/Mastercard
   - 🏦 Bank transfers
5. **After payment:**
   - PesaPal sends webhook notification
   - System verifies transaction
   - User subscription activated
   - End date calculated based on plan duration
