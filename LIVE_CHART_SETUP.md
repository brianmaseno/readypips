## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Alert Sound File

The notification system needs an audio file to play when new signals arrive.

**Option A: Download Free Notification Sound**
1. Visit one of these sites:
   - https://freesound.org/ (search "notification" or "alert")
   - https://notificationsounds.com/
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/notification/

2. Download a short sound file (recommended: 1-3 seconds)

3. Convert to MP3 format if needed (use https://cloudconvert.com/to-mp3)

4. Rename the file to `alert.mp3`

5. Place it in: `public/sounds/alert.mp3`

**Option B: Use Default System Sound**
If you don't add a sound file, the system will attempt to play but fail silently (no error). Users will still see visual notifications.

## 📧 Email Configuration (Hostinger)

Since you're using Hostinger email (`no-reply@readypips.com`), update your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration - Hostinger SMTP
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=no-reply@readypips.com
SMTP_PASS=your_actual_password_here
SMTP_FROM_NAME=ReadyPips
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@readypips.com
```

**Important:** Replace `your_actual_password_here` with the password you use to login to https://mail.hostinger.com

**Note:** Hostinger doesn't use "App Passwords" like Gmail. Just use your regular email password.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sound Doesn't Play
- Check if `alert.mp3` exists in `public/sounds/`
- Check browser console for audio errors
- Some browsers block auto-play audio (user interaction needed first)

### Chart Doesn't Load
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify TradingView script loads (check Network tab)
- Try different currency pair

### Notifications Don't Appear
- Check if signals exist in database
- Verify API endpoint `/api/signals?pair=EURUSD` returns data
- Check browser console for fetch errors

### Analysis Panel Shows Mock Data
- If `/api/analysis` endpoint has issues, it falls back to mock data
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify signals collection has data
